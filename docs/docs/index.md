Welcome to ReStack - a self-hosted, open-source project designed to run scripts anywhere!

## About ReStack

ReStack is an application originally created to automate updates to self hosted infrastructure. This manual process was "time-consuming" and prone to errors. To streamline this workflow, I developed ReStack - a tool that allows you to execute custom scripts in various environments, providing a flexible and customizable solution for running scripts on your own servers.

## Key Features

- **Self-Hosted**: Run ReStack on your own infrastructure, giving you full control over your environment and data.
- **Script Execution**: Execute custom scripts.
- **Script Management**: Organize and manage your scripts efficiently.
- **Environment Flexibility**: Run scripts in different environments, including local machines, servers, and containers.

## Getting Started

To get started with ReStack, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Install ReStack on your server using Docker.
2. **Script Creation**: Create custom scripts tailored to your specific requirements.
3. **Execution**: Execute scripts using ReStack's intuitive interface or API endpoints.
